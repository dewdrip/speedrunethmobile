# üöÄ SpeedRun Ethereum with ETH Mobile + Bounties! üí∞

[SpeedRun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com) is a series of challenges designed to teach and test your skills in Ethereum smart contract development. Each challenge focuses on a different aspect of building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum.

[ETH Mobile](https://ethmobile.io) brings these challenges to mobile devices, transforming each SpeedRun Ethereum challenge into a fully functional mobile dApp. This allows users to interact with Ethereum smart contracts directly from their phones, providing a seamless and accessible experience.

## The Challenges

Each challenge is implemented in a separate branch in this repository:

1. [Challenge 0](https://github.com/dewdrip/speedrunethmobile/tree/challenge-0-simple-nft): This is a simple app that lets users mint and transfer NFTs.

2. [Challenge 1](https://github.com/dewdrip/eth-mobile/tree/challenge-1-decentralized-staking): This is an app where users can coordinate a group funding effort. If the users cooperate, the money is collected in a second smart contract. If they defect, the worst that can happen is everyone gets their money back. The users only have to trust the code.

3. [Challenge 2](https://github.com/dewdrip/speedrunethmobile/tree/challenge-2-token-vendor): This is an app that lets users purchase your ERC20 token, transfer it, and sell it back to the vendor.

4. [Challenge 4](https://github.com/dewdrip/speedrunethmobile/tree/challenge-4-dex): This is an app that allows users to seamlessly trade ERC20 BALLOONS ($BAL) with ETH in a decentralized manner. Users will be able to view their token balances, provide or withdraw liquidity, and buy or sell their tokens according to a price formula!

5. [Challenge 5](https://github.com/dewdrip/speedrunethmobile/tree/challenge-5-over-collateralized-lending): This is an app that allows anyone to take out a loan in CORN while making sure it is always backed by it's value in ETH.

6. [Challenge 9](https://github.com/dewdrip/speedrunethmobile/tree/challenge-9-svg-nft): This is an app which lets users purchase uniquely generated SVG Images with ‚Äúrandom‚Äù properties on-chain.

## Bounties! üí∞

We're rewarding builders who complete the **3 missing challenges(Dice Game, Prediction Market & MultiSig)** and come out on top.

- $50 for the Dice Game
- $100 for the Prediction Market
- $150 for the MultiSig

#### How to submit your builds

We follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the project
3. Create a new branch with a descriptive name - e.g challenge-n
4. Commit your changes to the new branch
5. Push changes to your fork
6. Open a PR in our repository. Your branch should be set to merge into the respective challenge branch
7. Tag the judge to review your PR

Here are some tips for a high-quality submission:

- Create a title for the PR that accurately defines the work done - **Challenge N by YOUR_NAME**.
- Structure the description neatly to make it easy to consume. For example, you can include bullet points and screenshots instead of having one large paragraph.
- Have a good commit message that summarises the work done.

Once you submit your PR:

- We may ask questions, request additional information or ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. Please note that these are to make the PR clear for everyone involved and aims to create a frictionless interaction process.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation resolved.

Once the PR is approved, we'll "squash-and-merge" to keep the git commit history clean

#### Evaluation Criteria

- Apps must be built with ETH Mobile.
- Apps do not need to be deployed but MUST work seamlessly on Android & IOS.
- Smart contract tests must be thourough.

Bounties end on **Sept 1st.**
